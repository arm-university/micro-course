# micro:course
Our micro:course is a colourful, introductory book of projects that guides learners from first principles of the micro:bit through to the use of Python. It is intended for self-study and includes full explanations of each project, with all code also provided. It is available in two versions: for micro:bit v1 and for v2.

updated

Which version should I use? If you are using micro:bit v1s, we recommend downloading the v1 version of the micro:course. If you are using micro:bit v1 or a mixture of v1s and v2s, we recommend the v2 version, which clearly indicates which tasks relate specifically to v2 users.

## Resource Aim
To introduce, inspire and engage learners to study Physical Computing as well as serving as an introduction to the pedagogy and resources offered in our full courses.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learners will understand and apply the fundamental computational techniques to solve contextualised problems
- Learners will apply computational techniques including abstraction, decomposition logic and algorithms
- Learners will become more confident in using micro:bits to build Physical Computing projects
- Learners will understand how technology can be applied to the real world
  
## Resource structure
The micro:course is a series of individual projects that build in complexity.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
